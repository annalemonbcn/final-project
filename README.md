**By Anna Esteve**
This is the final project for Ironhack Frontend Web Development Bootcamp. So, what have I done?
## OVERVIEW

* Free design
* Theme: to-do list/kanban
* Minimum requirements in terms of technologies and purposes
## FINAL RESULT

## PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
The project has been developed under defined technical principles, as well as minimum interaction requirements.
### Tech specs
* **Client:** Vue.js + Vite
* **Router:** Vue Router
* **Store:** Pinia
* **Database as a service:** Supabase
### Deliverables
* Authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
* A front-end that displays the userâ€™s personal to-do list
* An ability to add new tasks
* An ability to edit existing tasks
* An ability to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
* An ability to delete existing tasks
* A store and a database that your app can call data from
### Global aspects
* Impossibility of accessing the application without previous sign in
* Possibility of sending personalized password recovery email
* Side navigation with hover to make the most of the workspace
* Easy and intuitive interface: easy to mark tasks as done/undone

* Similar design for mobile and desktop, to prevent the jump between devices from implying a new learning process on the part of the user
* 404 page with link back to home
## FINAL CONCLUSIONS
* This project had to be executed in a total of 12 didactic sessions, approximately 56-60 hours. In my case, I have dedicated many more hours, since my intention was to **end up with a solid project**.
* **What I liked the most:** the onboarding part. It's been interesting for me to learn about this process first hand.
* **The biggest challenge:** the connection and persistence of the logged in user. I have requested help from the teachers to get it going. Also fight with the docu of different plugins and libraries to implement according to what functionalities.
* **What I liked least:** think about the design of the application and the UX/UI

This project will have updates and improvements in the future.
However, I am happy with the final result :)
